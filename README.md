## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

An app to play a game of Poker Square!

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

1. A package manager (e.g. npm or yarn)
2. A server environment (e.g. Node)
3. A code editor (e.g. VS Code or Atom)

### Installing

1. Download the repo
2. Install the packages (npm install or yarn install)
3. The code can be editted with any code editor
4. Start a dev server with `npm install` or `yarn install` as appropriate

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

With the dev server deployed, open a browser to Localhost:3000. Alternately, an optimized production build can be created with `npm run build` or `yarn run build`, which will create a build folder with an html file that can be opened.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

All that should be required for deployment is the code and a browser to run it in.
